Spring Data - Key Value - Examples
==================================

Examples featuring [Spring Data](https://www.springsource.org/spring-data) Key Value project.
The primary goal of the [Spring Data](https://www.springsource.org/spring-data) project is to make it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use new data access technologies such as non-relational databases, map-reduce frameworks, and cloud based data services.
As the name implies, the **Key Value** modules provides integration with key value stores such as [Redis](https://code.google.com/p/redis/) and [Riak](https://riak.com/Riak.html).
